"""Exam-style partial credit — single-file, fully removable as a unit.

## Formula

For a single sample, denote the question's correct-answer set as $G$ and
the model's parsed option set as $\\hat S$:

$$
\\text{exam\\_score}(\\hat S, G) = \\begin{cases}
|\\hat S \\cap G| / |G| & \\text{if } \\hat S \\setminus G = \\emptyset \\\\
0 & \\text{if } \\hat S \\setminus G \\ne \\emptyset
\\end{cases}
$$

Aggregation uses two steps: per-question mean -> across-question mean.
First compute $e_q$ for each question $q$ over the in-base samples, then
take the equal-weight mean across all questions; an empty base at either
step returns `None`.

## Semantics

Reinterprets SAMPLING_N from this metric's perspective as "the number of
independent exam attempts": each attempt scores independently in 0~1, and
the arithmetic mean is taken at the end. Formally equivalent to
**"Recall under zero-FP gate"** — Recall with an added hard gate of
"any FP triggers a veto".

## Differences from existing scores

| Metric | Formula | FP penalty | FN penalty | Single-choice degeneracy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parser.is_correct` (strict) | only $\\hat S = G$ scores 1 | 0 | 0 | 0/1 |
| `tversky_score(alpha=2,beta=0.5)`+chance correction -> `fss` | soft FP/FN penalty | alpha-fold | beta-fold | with chance |
| `hamming_score` | $1 - \\text{XOR-bits}/k$ | symmetric to FN | symmetric to FP | 0/1 |
| **`exam_score` (this file)** | TP/|G|·1(FP=0) | veto | proportional deduction | 0/1 |

`exam_score`'s selling point is "explainable in one sentence": any FP
scores 0, otherwise it scores by the correct-answer proportion.

## Removal-equivalence constraint

This file, `tests/test_exam_score.py`, the few hook points in `accuracy.py` /
`writers.py` carrying grep-able comment markers, and the segments wrapped
in HTML comments inside `README.md` / `DESIGN.md` / `FRAME.md` /
`.env.example` together form a minimal closure that can be removed in one
shot. After removal, the repository must return to a byte-identical state
prior to this change (existing tests must all pass, existing CSV columns
must be byte-identical, no residue in documentation segments). Marker
literals are in `openspec/changes/add-exam-score-metric/design.md` §D8.

Allowed dependency surface: standard library, `flatten.SampleRow`,
`flatten._group_by_question`. SHALL NOT reverse-depend on `accuracy.py` /
`proper_score.py` / `consistency.py` / `writers.py` / `inference.py` /
`behavior.py` / `grid.py`; otherwise the minimal closure cannot be located
during removal.
