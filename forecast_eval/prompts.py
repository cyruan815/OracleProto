**Forecasting Protocol — follow every step before producing the final \\boxed{...} answer.**

1. **Decompose.** Privately list the sub-questions whose answers, taken together, settle this prediction. Note the entities, dates, quantities, and definitions that need to be pinned down.

2. **Plan distinct angles.** Before issuing any `web_search`, list at least three SEPARATE investigation angles that use different keywords and look at different evidence types — for example direct event reporting, official statements/data, betting markets or polls, expert analysis, base rates from similar past events, contradictory or skeptical sources. Re-phrasing the same query is NOT a new angle.

3. **Search iteratively, reflect after every result.** Each time `web_search` returns:
   - In your reasoning, paraphrase what the most relevant snippets actually said (do not copy them).
   - Tag each result as relevant / partially relevant / off-topic, and note its publication date.
   - Identify what new sub-question or contradiction the result raises.
   - Pick the next query to fill the largest remaining gap or cover an angle you have NOT yet exercised. Avoid near-duplicate queries.

4. **Cross-validate.** Do not commit to an answer until at least two independent sources (different domains, different publication dates) corroborate the key facts driving it. If only one source supports the conclusion, search again from a fresh angle.

5. **Stress-test the opposite.** Explicitly ask "What is the strongest case for the OPPOSITE outcome?" If you cannot articulate it from the evidence you have gathered, run a search aimed at that counter-case. Then weigh both sides.

6. **Calibrate, then commit.** State your confidence (low / medium / high), the single most likely failure mode of your prediction, and the most decisive piece of evidence. Only after this self-check, output the final answer in the exact required `\\boxed{...}` format on the last line.

**Quality bar.** A confident answer with only one search is almost always under-researched on this benchmark; multi-angle searches with explicit reflection consistently outperform one-shot guesses. Use the `web_search` tool generously — your search budget is large enough to support thorough investigation. Do NOT skip the protocol even if the answer feels obvious.

# Belief protocol. Appended AFTER reflection protocol when both are enabled.
# Like reflection it's a tail-attachment to the user message: NOT part of
# `prompt_templates`, so `prompt_templates_hash` is unchanged; the fingerprint
# lives in `run_meta.belief_protocol_text` / `belief_protocol_hash`.
#
# Design intent: convert the model's implicit "evidence -> chosen letter" into
# an explicit, scoreable probability vector, so the analysis layer can compute
# proper scoring rules (Brier / NLL / MBS), calibration (ECE / Murphy
# decomposition), and behavioral metrics (belief evolution, confidence
# diagnosis) without re-prompting. Boxed answer remains for backward compat.
BELIEF_PROTOCOL = """\

---
**Belief Protocol — emit a structured probability block BEFORE every `\\boxed{...}` answer.**

After completing the forecasting protocol above, output a `<belief>...</belief>` block on its own line(s), THEN the final `\\boxed{...}` answer. The belief block is the object that gets scored by proper scoring rules (Brier / NLL); the boxed answer is kept only for backward compatibility. Probabilities matter — being well-calibrated beats being overconfident, even when the boxed letter is the same.

**Required JSON schema** (strict; emit valid JSON only — no comments, no trailing commas):

```
<belief>{
  "version": "v4.0",
  "probabilities": { "<letter>": <float in [0, 1]>, ... },
  "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "key_evidence":     [ "<= 280 chars per bullet, 1-4 bullets",  ... ],
  "counterevidence":  [ "<= 280 chars per bullet, 0-3 bullets",  ... ],
  "open_questions":   [ "<= 280 chars per bullet, 0-3 bullets",  ... ],
  "decision_rule": "argmax" | "multi-select@<threshold>"
}</belief>
```

**Probability rules.**
- Use the SAME letter labels (`A`, `B`, ...) shown in the question's outcomes block. Emit one entry per outcome — every letter present in the question MUST appear as a key.
- For single-answer questions (yes_no / binary_named / multiple_choice with one true label): the values MUST sum to `1.0` (tolerance `1e-3`).
- For multi-select questions: each value is an INDEPENDENT Bernoulli (probability that THAT outcome is in the true set); values do NOT need to sum to 1.
- Each value MUST lie in `[0, 1]`. Avoid the boundary unless you really mean it: `0.99` says "I'd accept long odds against this being wrong"; pick `0.85` if you would not.

**Calibration norms.**
- Calibrated probabilities are the goal. If you searched once and feel "maybe 60%", emit `0.6`, not `0.9`. Overconfidence is penalised quadratically (Brier) and exponentially (NLL).
- `confidence` is your subjective bucket; pair it honestly with the spread of `probabilities`. `"high"` + flat distribution is incoherent.
- `key_evidence` lists the strongest 1-4 facts that DROVE your top probability. `counterevidence` is the best case AGAINST your top choice — emit it even when you reject it; an empty `counterevidence` on a non-trivial question is a red flag.
- `decision_rule` is `"argmax"` for single-answer; for multi-select, use `"multi-select@<t>"` with `<t>` your inclusion threshold (e.g. `"multi-select@0.5"`).

**Output order (exact).**
1. Your reasoning / search reflection (free text — anywhere in the message).
2. The `<belief>{...}</belief>` JSON block.
3. The final `\\boxed{...}` answer on the LAST line.

If you cannot produce a valid belief block, emit your boxed answer anyway — the boxed path is independent and will still be scored. But a missing or malformed belief block costs you the probabilistic family of metrics for this sample, so default to emitting one whenever your reasoning supports it.
